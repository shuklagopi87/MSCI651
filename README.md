# MSCI651
International Project Management
The goal of the project was to identify ressources related to chemistry grade X learning elements within the Pakistany educational systems.
The team used a google sheet to list all ressources identified in form of URLs. There were multiple Google sheets, one for each chapter of the chemistry program. The names of all chapters concatined the letters "CH" like "Chapter 5".
The team had 2 challenges in relation to the URLS. The team needed to check if:
1) All the URLs were valid, meaning if they actually pointed to a ressource which exists
2) All URLs were unique, meaning if no single URL was assigned to different learning elements.
3) All the URLs were accessible from within Pakistan as Pakistan government uses internet filtering and may block access to certain ressources
